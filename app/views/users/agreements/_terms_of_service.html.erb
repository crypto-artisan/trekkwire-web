In the event of any Dispute between the Parties concerning the terms and provisions of these Terms, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to collect from the other Party all costs incurred in such dispute, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> We want to address your concerns without the necessity of a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against trekkwire, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto:support@trekkwire.com">support@trekkwire.com</a>. trekkwire will contact you by email as part of a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute informally. If a Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after submission, you or trekkwire may bring a formal proceeding.</li>
        <li><strong>Arbitration Agreement.</strong> You and trekkwire each agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, or any other location we agree to. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or trekkwire may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in St. Louis, Missouri or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of Trekkwire, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above.</li>
        <li><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> You may only resolve Disputes with trekkwire on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Property Disputes.</strong> Notwithstanding the Parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation, but not, for clarity, claims related to the license granted to you for Trekkwire under these Terms. Either Party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</li>
        <li><strong>Limitation on Claims.</strong> Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of Trekkwire must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever. To the extent that the arbitration agreement is not enforceable, each party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal, state, and local courts in St. Louis, Missouri for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>General Terms</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Relationship of Parties.</strong> No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and trekkwire as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services.</li>

These Terms may be executed by the parties in one or more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original and such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.</li>

We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Governing Law.</strong> Except as otherwise required by applicable law, these Terms and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</li>
        <li><strong>Waiver; Severability.</strong> trekkwire' failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of that provision or any other provision of these Terms.If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to accomplish, as nearly as possible, the objective thereof, or shall be severed from the document if, and solely, to the limited extent such construction is not possible, and the remaining portion of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Amendment.</strong> We may amend these Terms from time to time by updating this page as evidenced by revising the "Last Updated" date noted at the top of this posting. Once you accept these Terms, the then-current version shall apply each time you access or use the Services. Nothing in these Terms will be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.</li>
